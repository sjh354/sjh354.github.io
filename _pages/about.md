I am a college student majoring in CS in Korea and I am mainly interested in artificial intelligence.

Currently an undergraduate student with a strong interest in artificial intelligence and machine learning, I focus on developing practical skills and understanding core concepts.
My academic journey involves hands-on programming, data analysis, and exploring AI algorithms to solve real-world problems. I enjoy combining theoretical study with projects to deepen my knowledge and experience.

Outside of academics, my hobbies include tech tutorials, weight lifting, hardware tinkering, and stock market analysis â€” where Iâ€™m trying to outsmart the market by predicting it through time series forecasting, hoping to make easy money without breaking a sweat.ðŸ˜‰
